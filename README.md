# SpongeOfThings

v1.2 March, 2019

You can now access the code for  this site in the [real_site](https://github.com/stephanieMiranda/SpongeOfThings/tree/master/real_site/thestephaniemiranda) folder of this repository. There is a simple template I'm using in the html file to create new pages as necessary. Because the site is directly changed on cPanel which utilizes Twitter Bootstrap, there are occasional minor differences between the code here and the code being hosted. I have not yet found how to link my cPanel to this repository.


v1.1 November, 2018

I've changed the name of the site's domain to thestephaniemiranda.com, and have since moved the site to a new web hosting service. Information about this move can be found in the wiki.


v1 July, 2018

This project is the build of my personal website. This is a multipurpose project. First purpose was to create a personal sever on a Raspberry Pi model 3. Second purpose, learn Bootstrap and further my design/build skills. Third purpose, create a website that can be used for professional growth. This website will act as a sort of portfolio/resume. 


### Notes
Please see the Wiki pages for full project description and process. *I had to go back and add the Bootstrap after the fact, and in doing so had to find the right links and scripts to get the Bootstrap and JQuery to function properly.*
