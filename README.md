# SpongeOfThings

v1 July, 2018

This project is the build of my personal website. This is a multipurpose project. First purpose was to create a personal sever on a Raspberry Pi model 3. Second purpose, learn Bootstrap and further my design/build skills. Third purpose, create a website that can be used for professional growth. This website will act as a sort of portfolio/resume. 

## Raspberry Pi Server

There were several resources used. The first link was the main outline, but I had to make some adjustments to update libraries and other downloads. My operating system on the RaspberryPi is Debian 9. The machine is sharing a screen with my laptop currently, and is wired directly to ethernet, so that I may disconnect the server any time I choose. (Still have several more links to add, but here is a start to documentation.)
