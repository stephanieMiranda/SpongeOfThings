# SpongeOfThings

v1 July, 2018

This project is the build of my personal website. This is a multipurpose project. First purpose was to create a personal sever on a Raspberry Pi model 3. Second purpose, learn Bootstrap and further my design/build skills. Third purpose, create a website that can be used for professional growth. This website will act as a sort of portfolio/resume. 


### Notes
Please see the Wiki pages for full project description and process. *I had to go back and add the Bootstrap after the fact, and in doing so had to find the right links and scripts to get the Bootstrap and JQuery to function properly.*
