# SpongeOfThings

v1 July, 2018

This project is the build of my personal website. This is a multipurpose project. First purpose was to create a personal sever on a Raspberry Pi model 3. Second purpose, learn Bootstrap and further my design/build skills. Third purpose, create a website that can be used for professional growth. This website will act as a sort of portfolio/resume. 

## Raspberry Pi Server

There were several resources used. The first link was the main outline, but I had to make some adjustments to update libraries and other downloads. My operating system on the RaspberryPi is Debian 9. The machine is sharing a screen with my laptop currently, and is wired directly to ethernet, so that I may disconnect the server any time I choose. (Still have several more links to add, but here is a start to documentation.) The domain I used, was created using a Dymamic DNS setup. This allows the dynamic IP address my ISP provides to be checked and re-routed to static location.

2) Domain handled for free using: https://www.noip.com/login?ref_url=console

## Designing/Building website

There were several resources used here. A sort of mixing and matching happened with these to get the look and feel I wanted out of the jumbotron, etc. (upload wireframes)

1) What is Bootstrap and How Do I Use It? article: https://www.taniarascia.com/what-is-bootstrap-and-how-do-i-use-it/
2) GetBootstrap website: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/#navbar
3) W3 schools: https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/tryit.asp?filename=trybs_temp_portfolio&stacked=h
4) https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/twitter-bootstrap-tutorial/bootstrap-carousel.php

### Notes
I began with a simple HTML file, just the index.html. I had to go back and add the Bootstrap after the fact, and in doing so had to find the right links and scripts to get the Bootstrap and JQuery to function properly.
